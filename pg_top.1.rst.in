SYNOPSIS
========

**pg_top** [option...] [number]

DESCRIPTION
===========

*pg_top* displays the top processes on the system and periodically updates this
information.  Raw cpu percentage is used to rank the processes.  If *number* is
given, then the top *number* processes will be displayed instead of the
default.

*pg_top* makes a distinction between terminals that support advanced
capabilities and those that do not.  This distinction affects the choice of
defaults for certain options.  In the remainder of this document, an
"intelligent" terminal is one that supports cursor addressing, clear screen,
and clear to end of line.  Conversely, a \*(lqdumb\*(rq terminal is one that
does not support such features.  If the output of *pg_top* is redirected to a
file, it acts as if it were being run on a dumb terminal.

OPTIONS
=======

-b, --batch   Use "batch" mode.  In this mode, all input from the terminal is
              ignored.  Interrupt characters (such as ^C and ^\e) still have an
              effect.  This is the default on a dumb terminal, or when the
              output is not a terminal.
-C, --color-mode   Turn off the use of color in the display.
-c, --show-command   Show the command name for each process. Default is to show
                     the full command line.  This option is not supported on
                     all platforms.
-h HOST, --host=HOST   Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is
                  running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the
                  directory for the Unix domain socket. The default is taken
                  from the PGHOST environment variable, if set.

-I, --hide-idle   Do not display idle processes.  By default, pg_top displays
                  both active and idle processes.
-i, --interactive   Use "lqinteractive" mode.  In this mode, any input is
                    immediately read for processing.  See the section on
                    "Interactive Mode" for an explanation of which keys perform
                    what functions.  After the command is processed, the screen
                    will immediately be updated, even if the command was not
                    understood.  This mode is the default when standard output
                    is an intelligent terminal.
-n, --non-interactive   Use "non-interactive" mode.  This is identical to
                        "batch" mode.
-o FIELD, --order-field=FIELD   Sort the process display area on the specified
                                field.  The field name is the name of the
                                column as seen in the output, but in lower
                                case.  Likely values are "cpu", "size", "res",
                                "xtime" and "qtime", but may vary on different
                                operating systems.  Note that not all operating
                                systems support this option.
-p PORT, --port=PORT   Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
                       extension on which the server is listening for
                       connections. Defaults to the PGPORT environment
                       variable, if set.
-R   Display WAL sender processes' replication activity to connected standby
     servers.  Only directly connected standbys are listed; no information is
     available about downstream standby servers.
-r, --remote-mode   Monitor a remote database where the database is on a system
                    other than where pg_top is running from.  *pg_top* will
                    monitor a remote database if it has the pg_proctab
                    extension installed.
-s TIME, --set-delay=TIME   Set the delay between screen updates to *TIME*
                            seconds.  The default delay between updates is 5
                            seconds.
-T, --show-tags   List all available color tags and the current set of tests
                  used for color highlighting, then exit.
-U USERNAME, --username=USERNAME   PostgreSQL database user name to connect as.
-V, --version   Write version number information to stderr then exit
                immediately.  No other processing takes place when this option
                is used.  To see current revision information while *pg_top* is
                running, use the help command "?".
-W, --password   Forces *pg_top* to prompt for a password before connecting to
                 a database.  *pg_top* will also keep the database connection
                 open while running, and will clear the database connection
                 from memory for security.
-X   Display I/O activity per process.  This depends on whether the platform
     *pg_top* is run on supports getting I/O statistics per process, or whether
     the database system that pg_proctab is installed on supports getting I/O
     statistics when *pg_top* attempts to get operating system statistics
     remotely.
-x COUNT, --set-display=COUNT   Show only *COUNT* displays, then exit.  A
                                display is considered to be one update of the
                                screen.  This option allows the user to select
                                the number of displays he wants to see before
                                *pg_top* automatically exits.  For intelligent
                                terminals, no upper limit is set.  The default
                                is 1 for dumb terminals.
-z USERNAME, --show-username=USERNAME   Show only those processes owned by
                                        *USERNAME*.  This option currently only
                                        accepts PostgreSQL database user names.

Both *COUNT* and *NUMBER* fields can be specified as "infinite", indicating
that they can stretch as far as possible.  This is accomplished by using any
proper prefix of the keywords "infinity", "maximum, or "all".  The default for
*COUNT* on an intelligent terminal is, in fact, *infinity*.

The environment variable **PG_TOP** is examined for options before the command
line is scanned.  This enables a user to set his or her own defaults.  The
number of processes to display can also be specified in the environment
variable **PG_TOP**.  The options **-C**, **-I**, and **\-u** are actually
toggles.  A second specification of any of these options will negate the first.
Thus a user who has the environment variable **PG_TOP** set to "-I" may use the
command "top -I" to see idle processes.

INTERACTIVE MODE
================

When *pg_top* is running in "interactive mode", it reads commands from the
terminal and acts upon them accordingly.  In this mode, the terminal is put in
"BREAK", so that a character will be processed as soon as it is typed.  Almost
always, a key will be pressed when *pg_top* is between displays; that is, while
it is waiting for *TIME* seconds to elapse.  If this is the case, the command
will be processed and the display will be updated immediately thereafter
(reflecting any changes that the command may have specified).  This happens
even if the command was incorrect.  If a key is pressed while *pg_top* is in
the middle of updating the display, it will finish the update and then process
the command.  Some commands require additional information, and the user will
be prompted accordingly.  While typing this information in, the user's erase
and kill keys (as set up by the command *stty*) are recognized, and a newline
terminates the input.

These commands are currently recognized (^L refers to control-L):

:^L: Redraw the screen.
:A: Display the actual query plan (EXPLAIN ANALYZE) of the currently running
    SQL statement by re-running the SQL statement (prompt for process id.)
:a: Display the top PostgreSQL processor activity. (default)
:C: Toggle the use of color in the display.
:c: Toggle the display of the full command line.
:d: Change the number of displays to show (prompt for new number).  Remember
    that the next display counts as one, so typing **d1** will make *pg_top*
    show one final display and then immediately exit.
:h or ?: Display a summary of the commands (help screen).  Version information
         is included in this display.
:E: Display re-determined execution plan (EXPLAIN) of the SQL statement by a
    backend process (prompt for process id.)
:i: Toggle the display of idle processes.
:L: Display the currently held locks by a backend process (prompt for process
    id.)
:n or #: Change the number of processes to display (prompt for new number).
:o: Change the order in which the display is sorted.  This command is not
    available on all systems.  The sort key names when viewing processes vary
    from system to system but usually include:  "cpu", "res", "size", "xtime"
    and "qtime".  The default is unsorted.  See the interactive help for
    available sort key names.
:Q: Display the currently running query of a backend process (prompt for
    process id.)
:q: Quit *pg_top*.
:s: Change the number of seconds to delay between displays (prompt for new
    number).
:u: Display only processes owned by a specific username (prompt for username).
    If the username specified is simply \*(lq+\*(rq, then processes belonging
    to all users will be displayed.

THE DISPLAY
===========

The actual display varies depending on the specific variant of Unix that the
machine is running.  This description may not exactly match what is seen by
pg_top running on this particular machine.  Differences are listed at the end
of this manual entry.

The top few lines of the display show general information about the state of
the system, including the last process id assigned to a process (on most
systems), the three load averages, the current time, the number of existing
processes, the number of processes in each state (sleeping, running, starting,
zombies, and stopped), and a percentage of time spent in each of the processor
states (user, nice, system, and idle).  It also includes information about
physical and virtual memory allocation.

The remainder of the screen displays information about individual processes.
This display is similar in spirit to *ps(1)* but it is not exactly the same.
The columns displayed by *pg_top* will differ slightly between operating
systems.  Generally, the following display are available:

ACTIVITY DISPLAY
================
:PID: The process id.
:USERNAME: Username of the process's owner (if **-u** is specified, a UID
           column will be substituted for USERNAME).
:SIZE: Total size of the process (text, data, and stack) given in kilobytes.
:RES: Resident memory: current amount of process memory that resides in
      physical memory, given in kilobytes.
:STATE: Current backend state (typically one of "idle", "active", "idltxn",
        "fast", "disable", or "stop".
:XTIME: Elapsed time since the current transactions started.
:QTIME: Elapsed time since the current query started.
:%CPU: Percentage of available cpu time used by this process.
:LOCKS: Number of locks granted to this process.
:COMMAND: Name of the command that the process is currently running.

I/O DISPLAY (Linux only)
========================

:PID: The process id.
:IOPS: Count the number of read and write I/O operations per second.
:IORPS: Count the number of read I/O operations per second.
:IOWPS: Count the number of write I/O operations per second.
:READS: Number of bytes read from storage.
:WRITES: Number of bytes written to storage.
:COMMAND: Name of the command that the process is currently running.

REPLICATION DISPLAY
===================
:PID: The process id.
:USERNAME: Name of the user logged into this WAL sender process
:APPLICATION: Name of the application that is connected to this WAL sender
:CLIENT: IP address of the client connected to this WAL sender
:STATE: Current WAL sender state
:PRIMARY: Current transaction log insert location on primary node
:SENT: Last write-ahead log location sent on this connection
:WRITE: Last write-ahead log location written to disk
:FLUSH: Last write-ahead log location flushed to disk
:REPLAY: Last write-ahead log location replayed into the database
:SLAG: Size of write-ahead log location remaining to be sent
:WLAG: Size of write-ahead log location remaining to be written to disk
:FLAG: Size of write-ahead log location remaining to be flushed to disk
:RLAG: Size of write-ahead log location remaining to be replayed into the
       database

COLOR
=====

*pg_top* supports the use of ANSI color in its output. By default, color is
available but not used.  The environment variable **PG_TOPCOLORS** specifies
colors to use and conditions for which they should be used.  At the present
time, only numbers in the summary display area can be colored. In a future
version it will be possible to highlight numbers in the process display area as
well.  The environment variable is the only way to specify color: there is no
equivalent command line option.  Note that the environment variable
**PG_TOPCOLOURS** is also understood. The British spelling takes precedence.
The use of color only works on terminals that understand and process ANSI color
escape sequences.

The environment variable is a sequence of color specifications, separated by
colons. Each specification takes the form tag=min,max#code where *tag* is the
name of the value to check, *min* and *max* specify a range for the value, and
*code* is an ANSI color code.  Multiple color codes can be listed and separated
with semi-colons.  A missing *min* implies the lowest possible value (usually
0) and a missing *max* implies infinity. The comma must always be present. When
specifying numbers for load averages, they should be multiplied by 100.  For
example, the specification **1min=500,1000#31** indicates that a 1 minute load
average between 5 and 10 should be displayed in red. Color attributes can be
combined.  For example, the specification **5min=1000,#37;41** indicates that a
5 minute load average higher than 10 should be displayed with white characters
on a red background. A special tag named *header* is used to control the color
of the header for process display.  It should be specified with no lower and
upper limits, specifically **header=,#** followed by the ANSI color code.

You can see a list of color codes recognized by this installation of pg_top
with the **-T** option.  This will also show the current set of tests used for
color highligting, as specified in the environment.

BUGS
====

As with *ps(1)*, things can change while *pg_top* is collecting information for
an update.  The picture it gives is only a close approximation to reality.
