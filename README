						and a cast of ... a few


pg_top is 'top' for PostgreSQL. It is derived from Unix Top. Similar to top,
pg_top allows you to monitor PostgreSQL processes. It also allows you to:

    * View currently running SQL statement of a process.
    * View query plan of a currently running SELECT statement.
    * View locks held by a process.

To compile and install "pg_top", read the file "INSTALL" and follow the
directions and advice contained therein.

If you make any kind of change to "pg_top" that you feel would be
beneficial to others who use this program, or if you find and fix a bug,
please send the change to the pg_top mailing list.

In order to monitor a remote database, the pg_proctab extension needs to be
created on the database to be monitored.  Any operating system that pg_proctab
supports can be monitored remotely on any operating system.  See details for
pg_protab here:

http://pgxn.org/dist/pg_proctab/

Be sure to read the FAQ enclosed with the distrubution.  It contains
answers to the most commonly asked questions about the configuration,
installation, and operation of pg_top.
